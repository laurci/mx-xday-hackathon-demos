This demo is a real game in the real world. You have 2 robots (one orange and one blue) and 2 controllers (one for each). They are sitting on a white surface (the arena). The scope of the game is to use your robot to push the other robot out of the arena. To start the game, each player must scan a QR code (each QR code matches one robot), and pay 0.01EGLD. At the end of the game, the winner will receive one RobotWars Winner SFT.
